## What is Capycity?

Capycity emerged by a project on the university [Coburg University of Applied Sciences And Arts](https://www.coburg-university.de/) in Coburg.
Goal of the project was to teach various things in C++ programming. So, a story driven project named Capycity has been created in which there are a folk of capybaras who wanted to create a city which is specialized in generating energy with help of technology for renewable energy. 

But before they could start with building the city they needed a plan and for creating a good plan they needed proper software. Creating such a software was the task of the project. There where four chapters where every chapter build on top of the one before. With the story driven approach and splitting in multiple chapters it was possible to teach various concepts of the C++ language as well how the process of software development works. 

That means that some tasks needed demanded to do things which taught a certain concept but was not practical for new requirements or where just bad practice which has been recognized in the next chapter where the required tasks had to be done with a better concept. This showed that it is quite normal that some solutions work for a certain requirement but after reviewing or changing requirements it might be necessary to change things and that software develops by this way.

The good feedback by the students motivated me to keep the Capycity universe alive and to use it to teach more topics within the computer science area. So this site contains everything related with the Capycity universe in a story driven way. The development of the universe will be told like that this is a regional news site of Capycity. Every progress will be documented and the exercises and solutions behind it will be published.
